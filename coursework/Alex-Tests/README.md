**CS325 Compiler Coursework - Test Cases**

This contains a bash shell per category which automatically runs the tests held within. These tests simply compile and run the file with accordance to your mccomp.cpp file.
It does not compare results, and simply echos what should have happened - so you will need to manually compare.

The categories contain:
- Scope errors: Tests your scope checker.
- Semantic errors: Tests your semantic checker by providing cases.
- Type errors: Tests your type checker by providing bad code and good code.


Cheers dits!
